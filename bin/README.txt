 TO GENERATE MAZE: uncomment big-bang at the bottom of the Examples class before running. 
                   If you want to generate the maze a little bit quicker comment out the tests
                   after you uncomment the big-bang test.
 
 To read about HOW to play the game read UserGuide.txt.
 
 To read about how the game is DESIGNED read Design.txt.
 
 In the game we met the bare minimum requirements AND we implemented all the whistles.
 
 The game board really shouldn't be any smaller than a 10x10 and it shouldn't be any larger
 than a 100x60 since we have a set cell size (our design choice due to time constraints)
