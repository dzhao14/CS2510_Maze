After running the game a maze will appear!

How to win:

Method 1: Use the arrow keys to move the player (red circle) through the maze. The goal is to move the player to the green 
square at the bottom left of the screen.

Method 2: Pressing either the 'b' key or 'd' key will cause the computer to start automatically solving the maze.
After pressing 'b' or 'd' your player will be moved back to the starting square and your player will not be allowed to 
move while the computer is solving the maze. The game is over when the computer solves the maze.
Pressing 'b' starts breadth first search.
Pressing 'd' starts depth first search.

Upon winning the game (using either method) a score screen will pop up stating the total number of moves and the number of 
wrong moves made during this solution. To hide the score screen press 'j'.

After pressing 'j' you'll see that the solution path is colored in pink.

How to play again:

During any point in the game press 'r' and a new maze of the same size will appear.

Notes:

Whenever a square is colored in cyan it means that the square has been visited.
When the player is solving the maze, backtracking doesn't affect the total moves counter!
  Therefore total moves is calculated by adding up the number of squares visited during the game. Visiting a square won't
  add to the counter.

Press 'h' will toggle all squares betwee their original color (white) and their acquired color throughout the game.

How to change the maze size:

If you want a harder or easier maze:
Go into MazeWorld.java and change the two constants, HEIGHT and WIDTH. Changing these constants will make your maze 
larger or smaller

If you want to scale the size of your maze:
Go into Node.java and change the constant CELL_SIZE. Changing this constant will scale your maze into a larger or smaller
maze.
